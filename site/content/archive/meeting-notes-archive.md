</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> ron suggests earlier deadline date maybe?</div>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><div> police interaction a-ok.</div>
</li>
<li><div> todo next year</div>
<ul>
<li><div> should have fundraisers at gates</div>
</li>
<li><div> don't drink before ride message should be broadcast louder, suggests tall steve</div>
</li>
<li><div> daniel suggests maybe less all-at-once downhill (eg hawthorne, burnside) - it's where all the big injuries seem to happen.</div>
</li>
<li><div> need new &amp; better start location</div>
</li>
<li><div> need better web presence on the shift webpages</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> rwest/bridgeport report from steph:</div>
<ul>
<li><div> good PR for 4 days of contractual relationship</div>
</li>
<li><div> no commitment to having to do it with them/the same again next year</div>
<ul>
<li><div> did give us $1100+ and kept us from being negative-balanced at the end of it all!</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>MCBF report</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><div> permitting probably not happening even next year</div>
</li>
<li><div> awesome event from fool's PoV</div>
</li>
<li><div> wishes for more event-by-bike including potty-moving, vendor delivery, etc.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> organic brian mentions - lightbar tent moved by bike across town &amp; mykle recruited people to do it &amp; it worked</div>
</li>
<li><div> could use more movers to do this by bike.</div>
</li>
<li><div> will need more recruits for setup and teardown</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> meghan as vol coord sez:</div>
<ul>
<li><div> don't be cocky about not having a permit, keep it on the DL</div>
</li>
<li><div> more people could volunteer, esp core team</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> robert reports humanure toilet success!  </div>
<ul>
<li><div> fool to help next year – need a lot more capacity!</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> next year?</div>
<ul>
<li><div> should put a link on the shift pages for mcbf if we want it to truly be a capstone</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> vote to reimburse the following costs:</div>
<ul>
<li><div> kickstarter $100 preimbursed by fool.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> pedalpalooza dates/extension for next year / bikesummer 2012 discussion</div>
<ul>
<li><div> fool &amp; others want a longer, less dense PP - less missed rides due to conflicting times</div>
</li>
<li><div> emily's suggestion of a subtitle for next year's PP “return of bikesummer” preserves pedalpalooza branding</div>
</li>
<li><div> suggestion: more messaging about making bike fun happen all summer regardless of pedalpalooza dates - before and during PP</div>
<ul>
<li><div> “hey you there's a whole summer, plan it later”</div>
</li>
<li><div> need better publicity to PP attendees &amp; non-shifties about rides that happen outside of pp</div>
<ul>
<li><div> perhaps recruit ride leaders to tell
 people about shift cal (via click thru message during PP ride schedule 
via calendar plus at rides)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> how we can make bike summer / shift promotion happen and not make pp a month long?</div>
<ul>
<li><div> robert suggests contacating scheduled ride leaders to do their or additional rides other times </div>
</li>
<li><div> seed calendar with “if you liked this, you might like X ride outside of pp”</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>needs more discussion at next meeting</strong></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Rules for what's allowed on the calendar</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Are commercial events allowed (e.g., realty tours)</div>
</li>
<li><div> Should commercial events be charged a fee?</div>
</li>
<li><div> Should commercial events be excluded from the printed PP calendar?</div>
</li>
<li><div> Are rules during PP different from rules for the year-round calendar?</div>
</li>
<li><div> Should non-bikey events be excluded? (e.g., pedestrian events, fitness events, 80's dance night at a bar)</div>
</li>
<li><div> If we add rules, how will we enforce those rules?</div>
<ul>
<li><div> make calendar say it explicitly? </div>
</li>
<li><div> velopalooza reached out to randos and bike clubs who charge for their rides to put rides on calendar</div>
<ul>
<li><div> fool thinks it would be great to get wheelmen etc on board like this</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> brian says: events should be totally
 free or if money is required it is to fund the actual ride, not for 
profit, must be organized specifically for cyclists.</div>
</li>
<li><div> at this point conversation basically
 devolved but consensus seemed to be: status quo is ok, we trust brian 
to patrol, and some somewhat commercial rides are ok sometimes, at our 
discretion.</div>
</li>
<li><div> some ideas for fun, funky rides came up:</div>
<ul>
<li><div> bike tour of car dealerships - brian to lead =)></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> fool to lead a ride thru walmart =)</div>
</li>
<li><div> lily to lead a ride to tour dead car dealerships and gas stations</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> <strong> fool to email to steve re posters</strong></div>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>fool post to pedalpalooza re: posters</strong></div>
</li>
<li><div> Idea for a media page on the website
 to direct the press to for articles, photos and info about Shift 
(especially now that we are garnering international attention)..could be
 added to the “Who We Are” page.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>tabled til next month</strong></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Old biz</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> financial status on shift/PP kickoff accounts</div>
<ul>
<li><div> WNBR (aka PPKP) account is close to breaking even.  </div>
</li>
<li><div> Shift has a reasonable sum between umbrella's bank and petty cash (several thousand).</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> we ate and drank</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wnbr_suggestions">WNBR suggestions:</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Daniel</strong> can we get 
portapotties or businesses to provide potties on the route? or maybe 
encourage people to use it before/after ride?  or at least mention to 
new riders on faq page and/or handout at gate.  might help cut back on 
riders using the city as their urinal.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> can we do two shorter loops?  some 
folks just don't want to ride that far.  practicality says probably not 
(Daniel points out we filled 2/3 of the route for the whole time this 
year) but maybe a cutoff for shorter route if we make the main route 
longer?  TBD w/ planning group</div>
</li>

</li>

<ul>
<li><div> start with steph</div>
<ul>
<li><div> maybe she'll work on commission?</div>

</li>
<li><div> mostly looking for $$ vs in kind, unless it was: mechanics, location, bike parking, portapotties, band, etc. </div>

<strong>Next meeting</strong>: we need a regular location, for next 
meeting. IPRC! Lily has us signed up. Let's return it there. Meeting 
Room, computers, central, downtown. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Treasurer report</strong>: Chris says kickoff party fund has 
around $4k; shift has $2500. Party $ cant be used for WNBR without 
negotiation with Umbrella.
</p>

<p>
<strong>WNBR</strong>: Carl has met with PPB- Dan Saltzman's office 
(police commish) supports but doesn't want it to conflict with Rose 
Parade. So June 19th-meaning wd be middle weekend, not kickoff weekend, 
of PP. 6/10 is parade, 6/26 is MCBF, segueing into Parkways as last 
event. (!)
Stephen Upchurch has taken on WNBR with no other dovetailed events, 
including party being nonessential- most work goes into that. They are 
looking into gathering spot, locations. Carl meeting with Merc, who's 
potentially hosting an afterparty, as well as other decentralized 
parties expected to crop up. Still need volunteers- cleanup, crowd 
wrangling. Lily can get ridealong EMTs who work on other events.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sponsorship of PP2010</strong>: Carl meeting with Merc to talk 
about bike issue, calendar, sponsorship. Merc doing printout etc. Carl 
meeting with PBOT.
Costs that want sponsorship: idea to offer a bag for clothes for wnbr? 
Could advertise afterparties. 
Fencing? Security?? For WNBR. Security is nice per Lily. 
Chris says Steph Routh is working w an immigrant group, could have 
translators and invite new immigrant communities on WNBR as empowerment.
 He will check with Steph.
</p>

<p>
Carl wonders if theres other promotion possibilities. Billboards, etc.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Poster artist</strong>: Tomas? Eric? Paul Z? Ask Justa to find someone? What about Carye Bye and Debbie West? Timeline: <em>April 30 is deadline for image</em>! We need artist by end of March. Carl talking to Justa!
</p>

<p>
Mercury: Carl has that covered.
</p>

<p>
<strong>MCBF</strong>: MCBF will be a more low-key unofficial event this
 year.  Organizers feel its current trajectory will only lead to 
selling-out, lameness, etc.  <strong>Those with ideas for the event and an interest in making it happen should contact Carl.</strong>
 Lily suggests someone can get hitched because permits are easier, if 
you want to do that Theo will help but timelines are still tight.
Evan offers to wear wear a wedding dress all day long.
No one is taking legal responsibility; event can get shut down at the 
last minute. 
There are still Umbrella MCBF funds. If someone wants to do this 
permitted, is possible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kickoff event on thursday</strong>: parade? Party? 
Evan wants to do “ride, not parade”
</p>

<p>
Ryan brings up formalized couch surfing exchange? Carl suggests also bikesharing. Ryan will email lily about couchsurfing..
Evan's business will do discount.
</p>

<p>
This pedalpalooza is big opportunity for new energy to come in and create new traditions!
</p>

Agenda for next meeting, at IPRC usual Biz time:

month advance planning and notice may be needed.  While some ideas about
 re-locating the ride away from downtown and sponsorships to pay fees 
were brought up, it was decided that the group organizing the ride 
should start with the basics before looking into details like permitting
 and fees.</div>

Treasurer Report by Emily (was told in the past not to post figures).
<br>
<br>

In response to Carl - Emily is still investigating that.  What happened 
last year is the city gave a donation of $2,000 for the calendars.  Merc
 charged us for printing and stuffing, was supposed to pay Shift $2,000,
 but Steph and Emily are still investigating what exactly happened last 
year in that regard.
<br>
<br>

Printing last year was done by Mercury's printers, not Community Newspapers, so a check had to be cut rather than a donation.
<br>
<br>

Website report: Canvas Dreams (webhost) foresaw a server that was going 
wonky and moved our site (free of charge) over to a new server. Also, 
our webhost notified us about the change well in advance (unlike our 
previous host where the change would be made and leaving us scratching 
our heads as to what to do).  Doing good with bandwidth. Disk space 
needs to be purged of two backup copies of the site.  During the server 
transition, 23,053 spam emails - specifically from shifttobikes.org (a 
long running history dating back to 2002) - flooded our mail system; 
SpamAssassin has since been enable for shifttobikes.org.
<br>
<br>

<em>Chris McCraw volunteered to accept all Brad Pitt spam-mails (April Fool's!)</em>
<br>
<br>

<strong>New biz - Pedalpalooza!</strong>
<br>
<br>

Lily - here are the basics: Meghan is master of all WNBR kickoff party 
etc stuff.  Sara is the Mercury rep and is coordinating the bike issue. 
 June 11th is scheduled publish date.  Carl Larson is the Shift-y 
contact with the Merc, and Meghan will be helping with that as well.  
Merc is tight on funds this year, so a money donation is tough, but Merc
 willing to work with Shift otherwise.
<br>
<br>

Shift PP calendar - who is doing it?  Who is formatting it?  Merc did 
the layout and sold the ads last year, and there is general agreement 
that we'd like to get the Merc to do it again this year.  Last year 
Shift gave the Merc a list of prior advertisers and we are willing to 
give them another copy of that list this year.  Last year, at least 2 
ads for the issue came out.  We would want 2 ads before June for the 
issue (1/4 pg b&amp;w was previous, asked for color)
<br>
<br>

Last year, the Mercury also provided the beer lady (OLCC contact, was 
not a bike rider).  Shift could also use security people for the event. 
Sarah is to ask two beefy, scary-big couriers to volunteer (if they get 
perks, like beer or free peeps?) They don't have to be licensed 
security, but they need to look menacing to keep the pervs and 
malcontents in line.  Michael - would be good to have a blogtown rep on 
the rides each night so the Merc has a “live feed” into the event.  
Meghan - would love to have one of the long, skinny, sexy ads on the 
Merc website.
<br>
<br>

Pedalpalooza “I saw you” - it's a form on the Merc website, so if we get
 Shifties to post to it en masse, it could be in the next issue after 
the WNBR.
<br>
<br>

Printed calendar - if the cost of the ads doesn't pay for the insert, will Shift have to pay in cash?
<br>
<br>

Deadline for content for the printed calendar?  Carl and Sara will work it out. <em>(Loose deadline is end of April for all posted ride events)</em>
<br>
<br>

Sara - does PP have a theme? Carl - “bikes vs. &lt;blank&gt;”  Timo - “Safe Routes to Beer”<br>

If you think of a theme befire April 10th, then email it to Sara - smirk@portlandmercury.com
<br>
<br>

Update on location of Pedalpalooza Dance Party - still in the works.
<br>
<br>

Money for Pedalpalooza Party money - Meghan would like a budget this year.
<br>
<br>

Timo - official request from Transportation Options
<br>
<br>

City - Shift would like to request again a donation for printing costs.
<br>
<br>

What is the budget this year for the kickoff party?  Last year it cost 
$3,200.  Kickoff party has applied as an Umbrella project.  Meghan will 
woo Umbrella this weekend.  Carl - last year, to keep OLCC happy, we 
told them we'd have paid, private security.  In order to be in 
compliance, we may need to provide them this year.
<br>
<br>

WNBR - what does Meghan need?  Find a location.  Audio Cinema, On Air - 
too small, Leftbank - crazy, Pedicab garage - security issues. 28th 
&amp; Sandy - old car dealership, real estate agent Kevin seemed 
responsive. Olympic Mills - may or may not be able to provide space in 
SE.  Lily looking at Interstate and Mississippi - across street from 
Widmer.
<br>
<br>

What Meghan needs (April 2nd and 3rd) is for everyone to bike streets 
they don't ordinarily ride and look for apparently unused spaces.
<br>
<br>

Disjecta would love to have us but the Templeton bldg is too small - only 600 capacity.
<br>
<br>

Meghan needs help with bands who want to play.  Send band suggestions her way.
<br>
<br>

Carl - we realized last year too late in the game that some companies 
can use it as a marketing opportunity and provide free stuff.
<br>
<br>

PP Poster artwork.  Carl says Juusta wants to do it.  Budget for poster in past: $400
Carl says he'll talk to Justa about timeline.  
Image needs to be easily made into silkscreen and cut up into smaller versions.
Other artist suggesions:  Aron Neils Stienke.
<br>
<br>

Pedalpalooza Torch:  Lily wants a torch to live and burn through all of Pedalpalooza.
<br>
<br>

Getting events on the calendar?  Need to have kickoff ride, WNBR, 
kickoff party and MCBF on the calendar.  Events so far are about on 
schedule.  Someone needs to nag, also nag on zoobomb forum.  Brian has 
list of everyone who has led an event in the past.  Chris McCraw 
volunteered to help Brian with the emailing.
<br>
<br>

Kickoff ride - St. Francis Park (framed by SE 11th, 12th, Oak, &amp; 
Stark) location obtained since Jan 2009 by Tom. Contact person for the 
park is Steve Stevens (is on the St. Francis park board).
<br>
<br>

Lily expressed an interest on getting the printed calendars earlier this
 year.  Carl will discuss it with Sara and try to get it earlier.
<br>
<br>

Timo: who's handling the poster and calendar distribution ride?  Idea for an alleycat.  Dan expressed interest in that.
<br>
<br>

Talked about moving deadline up a week.  Lily advocated moving it up if 
it wouldn't cause the Merc too much trouble, Carl committed to trying to
 work something out with the Merc through Sara.  
<br>
<br>

Handling pervs - how to deal with them?  Michael O'Leary objected to use
 of the word “handling”.
Meghan advocated having the security people take care of most of it.  
Tossed around idea of “your bike is your ticket”, depending on venue 
that would be a preferred method.  Talked about speaking with Robert 
Burchett - his friend A.J. can train volunteers for dealing with the 
pervs.
<br>
<br>

Meghan - we should use the shirts in Greg &amp; Nikki's attic.  Grey and
 brown shirts of varying sizes - 100 of them. (shirts for MCBF, that 
Shift sells)
<br>
<br>

Carl - it would be great to get more high school kids involved in 
Pedalpalooza.  Carl's target audience is high-schoolers and churchgoers.
  Also, would like to have some bike to church rides.  Also, new zoobomb
 pile might be dedicated before the rides.
<br>
<br>

Emily would like to step down as Treasurer of Shift in August, so if you
 find someone to do it, tell Emily - Chris McCraw volunteered.
<br>
<br>

Timo: Sunday Parkways falls during Pedalpalooza.
<br>
<br>

Shawn: is editor of Zinester's Guide to Portland, 4th edition released 
in 2006 - working on next edition, which will be out at the end of the 
year.  Biking is an integral part of the Zinester's Guide - this is the 
time to think about things that aren't in the Zinester's Guide and what 
should be, etc.  Looking at August deadline for getting things into the 
next printed edition.  Self-promotion is discouraged, write about other 
people's stuff, not your own.

A highly charged discussion about dealing with pervs (or those who have failed or forgotten basic social ethics)<br>

showing up and ruining events by copping-feels, excessive gawking, and 
rudeness unbecoming of specific seniors; a growing problem on the PP 
rides since 2006.
Some of the possible solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Be assertive with the perv. Let perv(s) know their actions are out of line with the general group fun</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create a Perv Patrol to work as a group to confront the perv(s)</div>
</li>
<li><div> take pictures of them, squirt them with water</div>
</li>
<li><div> tabled until feedback gleaned from personal professional contacts</div>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

Steve's PedalPalooza calendar is near ready;
will be unveiled after mini-bike winter.
<br>
<br>

Determined the Shift calendar is our calendar,
and will choose to do with events (particularly
ones acting largely as advertising for cash) as
are deemed fitting to Shift.
<br>
<br>

Agreed to accept sponsorship by CanvasDreams,
our (green, carbon-neutral) webhost. Specifically,
they will allow our excess data transfers for the months
of May and June, in exchange for references to them,
like a small wind-turbine graphic on the Shift site.

Shift Web Meeting - Col. Summers Park - 1:00-2:30pm<br>

Facilitator: What a silly notion 8-O<br>

Note Taker: An even stranger concept ;-)<br>

Attending (in order of appearance): Tom, Lisa, Tall Steve, Dat<br>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary</strong><br>

All was generally in consensus that the body of the shift content
needs to be <em>fresh</em> and ever changing. The type of content centered
on a need for ride stories, quotes, and feedback responses from the
community.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Specifics</strong><br>

Dat recommended regular community input of ride stories and personal tales
of biking (like last year's PP ride reports). The idea here is for viewers
(particularly newcomers) to the site to be inspired to hop on a bike, and
(for veteran bikers) a place to post comments about a ride. Discussion focused on
the means to encourage ride participants to report and new tools to help ease or
spark the writing juices.
</p>

<p>
Steve plans to re-incorporate last year's PP countdown timer on the home screen
and calendar, plus send reminders to post events to this year's PP calendar. 
</p>

<p>
Lisa recommended a donation link, discretely, but obviously displayed. Does
Umbrella have a PayPal account the Shift site can link to for donations? Does
Umbrella have some site to link to (period)?
</p>

<p>
Tom is seeking alternative, faster, and local web-hosting. Will be investigating canvasdreams
(a carbon-neutral and green company), as well as easystreet, and opus.
</p>

<p>
The idea of hosting a listserve on the shift host was loosely tossed around,
especially since RiseUp has been on a roller coaster of RiseUp/Down/Up/Down,
but no decision made.
</p>

<p>
As for the Shift splash (home) screen, the wiki feature will be replaced with revolving
images or ever-changing content, just as before, except with an emphasis on encouraging
input from the community, <em>hopefully</em>.
</p>

<p>
Blessings and Bike-speed to this endeavor.

Attending: Elly, Steph R, Bonnie, Emily, Danny J, Dat, Carl, Meghan<br>

</p>

<p>
Regular Biz:<br>

Treasury Report - Emily<br>

Shift's remaining balance with City Repair Project is being transfered 
to the newly established Umbrella account (without processing fees). A 
donation (anonymous?) will also be part of the initial account balance 
(processing fees apply). Balance will be somewhere in the neighborhood 
of $685.<br>

Forecast for PedalPalooza costs is roughly $4000 (printing et al). Start seeking donors!<br>

Still no replacement bookkeeper for Shift - considering VJ or Benjamin, no rush to replace Emily.<br>

</p>

<p>
Project Reports - Carl, Elly<br>

BonB is all good.<br>

</p>

<p>

<p>
Old Biz:<br>

Umbrella Transition -<br>

It's done!<br>

</p>

<p>
Printing - Elly, Emily<br>

Looking at costs.<br>

Carl suggests using Diesel Fuel Prints because they're local.<br>

Still need to some designs.<br>

</p>

<p>
Website Calendar -<br>

No report, talk of progress.<br>

</p>

<p>
PedalPalooza - Carl<br>

prospective donors. Carl &amp; Elly discussed collaborating.<br>

</p>

<p>
TCC Seed Money -<br>

Funds earmarked “carfree” from Shift's CRP account will be available to 
TCC for eligible costs (printing related). Seed money agreed upon

Discussed TCC's need for an accountant/purchase tracking.<br>

</p>

<p>
Storage -<br>

</p>

<p>
List Health -<br>

Still no monthly reminder of posting standards.<br>

List seems healthy at present.<br>

</p>

<p>
New Biz:<br>

Petty Cash to Umbrella Account? - Benjamin<br>

No. Umbrella's limitations on spending do not suit our needs.<br>

</p>

<p>
World Carfree Network Membership - Elly<br>

Membership has lapsed (and maybe have lapsed a long time ago).<br>

Elly is taking the reigns to get us back on track.<br>

Cost is $40/yr and we agreed to voluntarily pay back dues to support WCN.<br>

Need to work with Umbrella to make sure we can use our account for membership renewal.<br>

</p>

<p>
Letterhead - Carl<br>

Still has an old phone number on it, needs to be removed. Dat volunteered.<br>

</p>

<p>
Bike to Work Day - Dat<br>

Shift Meeting minutes - December 5th 2007
</p>

<p>
Matt, Steve, Elly, Dan J, Dat, Benjamin, Steph, Robert, Jeff, Bonnie, Emily, Brian
Steph facilitated the meeting
Minutes by Matt [edited by Benjamin]
</p>

<p>
Umbrella transition update - Steph
we're working through the accounting, need primary contact from Shift - 
in the past this was Emily, but since she's stepping down as treasurer, 
we need someone else. Contact would be best served by the person acting 
as Shift's treasurer, but that's up to Shift. (since the main interface 
w/ Umbrella from Shift would be financial in nature) Matt and Steph are 
ineligible due to serving on Umbrella's Board (conflict of interest), as
 are Carl, Dat.
A number of people recommended Timo as the contact person, or Ben 
Salzburg.
Matt described what being the point of contact person entails (Matt, 
elaborate for the minutes) [editor note: umm… I forgot]
Also recommended as possibles: Carye, Curt, Kirsty
Elly volunteered to send out request to the Shift list for a contact 
person. Benjamin would be willing to do it - everyone present agreed 
that would be a lovely idea. Benjamin is the contact person for Shift 
[editor note: aw snap!].
</p>

<p>
Emily - Finances
Hindi said it looked like Shift has a balance of -$28 [yes, negative], but Emily's records show a balance of $674.62
Voted to pay Michael Rasmussen for domains - he is remaining the technical contact for <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> and the domain(s)
[update: explanation of the budget discrepancies on shiftadmin e-mail list]
</p>

<p>
Carfree Day jar money? Question in October about what happened to that -
 it went to the carfree group, and the money did not go missing.
</p>

<p>
Accountant bookkeeping help - Emily put out a call, received no 
responses, but Emily talked to Vicki on the bus, and she was tentatively
 interested.
</p>

<p>
Robert - when Shift goes under Umbrella, is the petty cash fund going to
 be normalized? Petty cash should probably be on the agenda.
</p>

<p>
Shift Roles - ongoing project, nothing to report
Shift Printing - stickers. Approved using $100 out of petty cash for 
stickers. Emily is heading up the stickers project
New Calendar - progress is being made, Steve was able to work on it for 4
 hours last week, he hopes to have something to show us before the end 
of the year (hopefully a demo by end of year, but no promises)
PP2008 - Ben talked to Gabe, preliminary to getting people involved in 
PP2008.
Matt to-do: talk to Carl and Carye about editing the PP2008 program 
(they did prior years)
</p>

<p>
Shift Mission Statement: we're ok
Nov 16 Traffic Rally recap - lots of news coverage, lots of people got 
on bikes. Does Shift want to get more involved in this and similar in 
the future? Specifically does Shift want to continue to support We Are 
All Traffic as possible and appropriate? [answer: Yes]
</p>

<p>
BonB - BonB North decided to voluntarily kick themselves off the bridge 
and are having a ride Monday the 10th (6pm) to determine the new 
location for BonB north. Benjamin received a $20 cash donation from an 
anonymous donor which was used to pay for coffee and pastries [not 
anonymous- he's one of our favorite Portland bikers! let's call it… 
mysterious donor].
</p>

<p>
TCC Update - they are moving right along - main effort is on 
sponsorship. Elly trying to get more people on the Shift list involved 
in TCC. Elly requesting if Shift would be willing to make a contribution
 to TCC to cover some administrative and mailing costs. Shift authorized
 up to $300
Benjamin - put on next month's agenda how Shift is helping TCC from a 
monetary standpoint (donations vs. loans, etc)
</p>

<p>
Community and School Traffic Safety Partnership (CSTSP) fund - PSAs - 
Dat wants to get people involved to create PSAs and wants Shift to be 
involved. [we all say go for it! look forward to hearing about progress.
 no statement of Shift involvement at this time.]
</p>

<p>
Ken's garage - There is still stuff in Ken's garage that needs to get 
out. Robert took an inventory and put it on the email list - there are 
items that Shift can use, or still uses, including a table and chairs, 
the MCBF arch, and the old smoothie bike.
Brian will talk to Kirstyn to see if she still plans to continue the 
Shift tradition with her smoothie bike
Brian is moving and may possibly have some space to maintain a Shift 
booth setup in storage - he is going to check if the other building 
occupants are ok with Shift people having keys to the storage area in 
the building.
</p>

<p>
Next business meeting is January 2nd.
Shift Meeting (meetup [holiday party?]) is December 19th
</p>

<p>
Shift mailing list - bike fun is no longer the main source of 
discussion, the current content is driving people away, can it be 
moderated? How can we make the list what it used to be? Options 
including moderation, change of format, and dissolving the list were 
discussed. Final decision was to self-police (discourage inappropriate 
matters and encourage bike fun) and revisit the situation/health of the 
list in 3 months if necessary.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section1172007">11/7/2007</h3>
<div>

<p>
In attendance – Organic Brian, “teknotus” Dan, Dat, The Metal Cowboy, 
Jonathan, Matt, Steph, Carl, Benjamin, Curt, Erin, Lisa, Tom, Tall 
Steve, Elly.
Meeting was facilitated by Steph with Elly and Steve taking over the 
Pedalpalooza discussion
</p>

<p>
What happened:
1. There was a half-hour discussion of the plans of various groups and 
individuals (several represented at this meeting) to hold a large 
demonstration and present a list of demands for cyclists rights. Shift 
will participate in this, and supports a demonstration to be held a week
 from this Friday, on November 16, during the day downtown. More 
discussion tabled (stay tuned here for more details!)
</p>

<p>
2. Umbrella update. Umbrella is now officially a 501c3. Shift is getting
 ready to make the transition of its fiscal sponsorship from City Repair
 to Umbrella. Carl filled out an application, which was approved. The 
plan is to transfer funds on January 1st. [update: 11/8/07 word received
 that account may be transfered before Jan 1]
</p>

<p>
3. Shift events tabling set-up report. Robert found that we have a table
 and chair. Elly was authorized to purchase 2 shift canopies for under 
$150 and will store them in her garage.
</p>

<p>
4. Online Calendar. Tall Steve is working on converting the pedalpalooza
 calendar to be Shift's year-round calendar, ending a long cycle of 
frustration and confusion. This news was greeted by applause and 
hooting. Thanks Steve! It's time consuming work, but should only be a 
few more months. [add: First calendar item proposed is the New Calendar 
Kegger- w00t!]
</p>

<p>
5. PEDALPALOOZA
Pedalpalooza this year will begin with a kickoff parade on Thursday, 
June 12 and the World Naked Bike Ride and kickoff dance party on 
Saturday, June 14. The festivities will close with Multnomah County Bike
 Fair on June 28th. (FYI, MMR will be on Friday the 13th!) There was 
discussion about making it longer, but we decided to table that till 
2009.
</p>

<p>
The online calendar will be open for you to submit your events starting 
in January. The deadline for events to be on the printed calendar will 
be May 1st again.
</p>

<p>
Tasks and roles:

</p>

<p>
Meeting space search results: 
Exchange Cycle Tours Brooklyn House 
Library 
Liberty Hall 
New Seasons 
Robert's House 
BTA Office
</p>

<p>
How do people feel?<br>

Carl is psyched about New Seasons (7 corners) (restriction - any day but
 Wednesday)  Liberty Hall requires payment, Carl objects to BTA to avoid
 confusion.<br>

Elly - most important is that it's central, objects to having it in 
someone's house because external events can cause inavailability.  Also 
strongly in favor of New Seasons<br>

Steph - ECT house is going to become a co-housing location (keep that in mind).  Also likes New Seasons<br>

Brian - opposed to library originally, but if recurring not a problem - 
then ok with it.  Also opposed with BTA office.  Likes New Seasons and 
ECT house<br>

Jeff - Belmont library meeting space is nice<br>

Emily - New Seasons, potential for more noise<br>

Steph called New Seasons - not available to non-New Seasons people.<br>

</p>

<p>
Proposal - reserve Belmont library for November - Passed
</p>

<p>
-Shift table - printing ideas and costs<br>

There was a Shift prescence/booth at the Belmont Street Fair, CFD events and Alberta Street Fair, how did that go?<br>

Bill Stites got sod, set up sod on parking spot - need for a canopy 
(Jeff Bernards' canopy borrowed for event), chairs, etc.  Sold t-shirts,
 gave away stickers and flyers - car-free focused<br>

Timo - has there been discussion as to what the Shift table is supposed to accomplish?  BonB, Shift list, etc?
Support expressed for “Shift Booth Kit”.<br>

Timo likes the idea of something to promote BonB, carfree conference, 
Pedalpalooza.  But it's been difficult at times to get people to commit 
to staffing the booth - need to have a clear idea of what the booth is 
for to express it to people to get them to volunteer.<br>

Elly - suggest invest in a canopy, folding table and at least 2 folding chairs<br>

opinion expressed that Belmont event was more like a party.  Is Shift 
just promoting bike fun?  If so, then Shift should be geared towards 
telling people where the party is, how to have their own parties, etc.<br>

Brian would like to see someone who has time to organize a Shift booth 
kit.  There is a fine balance between getting your message out to the 
masses at events and having so many events as to exhaust the volunteer 
pool.
Purpose of Shift and what to do with the Shift presence at various 
events.
</p>

<p>
Proposal for infrastructure for Shift Kit - canopy, table and chairs - Passed<br>

Generally agreed to set budget for items - $150<br>

Elly volunteers to research cost of canopy, table &amp; chairs.<br>

Robert has a key to Ken's garage, and is volunteering to talk to Ken and inventory what Shift stuff he is storing<br>

List of consumable supplies (printed goods) - suggested as topic for future meeting
</p>

<p>
-Light a Fire attendees / scholarships - they are giving us 2 tickets, 
$100 for additional tickets - a table (6 spots) would cost $400.<br>

Nominations for Shift reps to be given the two free tickets - Timo and Sara, they both accept (Sara by phone)
</p>

<p>
-See and Be Seen Bike Parade - November 8th (1st Thursday after Daylight Savings Time change)<br>

Starts near tugboat brewery - S. on Broadway, past Schnitz and then Park blocks to PSU.<br>

Timo's question - how do you talk to other bikers about behaviors that can help save their lives?<br>

He's sees several areas:<br>

Education<br>

Encouragement<br>

Enforcement - Selective in Portland, but for lights it is very severe in many Euro countries (e.g Sweden, Denmark)<br>

Elly proposes lending the mocktail equipment to Transportation Options for the bike parade event<br>

Could also have Shift literature include coupon<br>

CCC took over Jeff Bernard's lighting program (Get Lit), and is coordinating w/ Timo for the TransOptions event<br>

</p>

<p>
-Calendar - Carl says it sucks, we should get it off the website - it doesn't give real information<br>

It has been discussed in passed meetings that we like Steve Kirkendall's
 Pedalpalooza calendar and Steve has told us how much programming time 
is entailed in making that calendar the main Shift calendar.  Its a 
hefty bit of volunteer time.  Mykle Hanson has also expressed interest 
in helping Steve with the coding end of making a new calendar.<br>

Carl volunteers to email various interestead parties and try and coordinate movement toward a new calendar.<br>

</p>

<p>

IN ATTENANCE
</p>

<p>
 - Benjamin, Archer, Robert, Rachel, Emily, Brian
</p>

<p>
ANY NEW AGENDA ITEMS
</p>

<p>
 - no
</p>

<p>
OLD BIZ
</p>

<p>
 - Treasury report by Emily:  not much new news, shift balance (in City 
Repair account) is $614.42.  Hindi of City Repair is working on a 
statement for Shift.  There are $200 worth of checks for Shift jerseys 
that may not go into the account, they are more than six months old and 
had been in the custody of Dat.  Working on a budget for 2008.  If there
 are other important details that I missed, Emily feel free to post more
 info. - Shift Meetup report: Brian gave report of the Shift Meetup from
 August on 3rd Wednesday.  It was basically just Jonathan, Meghan, and 
Brian chatting about stuff especially how to get more people to the 
meetups.  We put this topic aside until end of meeting.
</p>

<p>
 - Umbrella:  progress to getting 501©3 status for the future fiscal 
home of Shift is on track.  Shift should have an alternate financial 
umbrella organization in mind for backup in case the deadline to leave 
City Repair is reached and for some reason (unlikely) Umbrella still 
does not have official status.
</p>

<p>
 - Shift roles:  progress is being made on defining Shift organizing 
roles and improving the process of handing-off roles and orienting new 
people to roles.  A template has been created for each organizer to 
describe what they do and how they do it, it is being discussed and will
 be distributed soon to the various Shift personalities.  Gabe &amp; 
Archer are working on a template for Pedalpalooza ads/publicity.  Also 
Brian has some printed info from Gabe, soon to go onto the Shift Wiki.  
Brian will follow up with Gabe on creating a process for the 
calendar/poster design and publicity coordinator(s).
</p>

<p>
 - Shift meeting future location:  Archer says Community Exchange Cycle 
Club is now in a big house near SE 40th/Brooklyn, this might be a 
possibility.  She will follow up with Steven Kung of CECC.  Another 
suggestion:  New Seasons stores have a Community Room (table?), Archer 
to follow up on this.  Rachel &amp; Robert offered to host meetings at 
their house, NE Going by 44th.  This was entusiastically received.  They
 would be willing to give up a house key to another Shifter when they 
will not be around at meeting time.  They also suggested that they could
 make a commitment of several months (six? twelve?).  Liberty Hall was 
brought up, again we have heard that they don't share the space for free
 any longer and if anyone is interested in this venue they should follow
 up on it.  Brian had researched some of the other locations brought up:
 - Alta Planning:  talked w/ Jessica, an employee would have to be 
around until end of meeting to lock up, seems unlikely, she ould discuss
 w/ Elicia and Mia and get back), River City Bicycles (again, an 
employee would have to volunteer to stay until end of meeting
 - PGE “Community Room” at NW EVerett &amp; 2nd:  a PGE employee would 
have to sponsor the meeting
 - Ecotrust:  the Atrium area is available for free, but it might or 
might not be locked after 6PM at the discretion of Hot Lips Pizza, and 
if another group has rented it then it won't be available
</p>

<p>
NEW BIZ
</p>

<p>
 - Shift booth:  Should we continue to have one at events, what do we 
need?  There seemed to be agreement that the Shift booth is valuable in 
getting new Shifties and eventually new organizers to replace those who 
burn out or “retire.”  Shift still has a banner, Benjamin knows how to 
get the Shift business cards, there are also plenty of shirts.  Needed 
mostly would be literature of some sort explaining what Shift is (didn't
 we have a tri-fold at one point?) or a Bike Bulletin.  There will 
likely not be a Shift booth at Belmont Street Fair/Portland Carfree Day 
Fair, but eventually we hope to pull all the stuff together.  We 
approved expenditure on minor expenses for materials, a budget will be 
brought up for making new Shift literature at next meeting.  Ben will 
try to retrieve Shift banner and look into getting the cards.
</p>

<p>
 - City Repair Coucil Meetings:  Anyone interested in going to City Repair council meetings?  no
</p>

<p>
 - Light a Fire Award:  Shift, among other people/groups, has won this 
award and there will be an awards dinner/ceremony on Oct. 30th.  
Conflicts with party plans!  Sort of… Halloween falls on a Wed this 
year, this would be Tue.  Shift has been offered two tickets to the 
event.  We suggested that Timo + whoever Timo wants could go 
(half-jokingly?).  Jonathan has offered to represent?  We brought up the
 possiblity of subsidized or scholarship tickets for several long-time 
and dedicated Shifties.  This was decided to be a possibility depending 
on the cost of the tickets, which will be checked upon by (who?  Ben 
again?).
</p>

<p>
 - Meetup:  Ben says we should bring up topics for casual discussion to 
motivate participation in Meetups.  This could be mainly scheming about 
fun event ideas.  Location ideas: Alameda Brewpub, Mash tun, 5th 
Quadrant, Ringler's near Hawthorne, Barley Mill Pub.  We decided to have
 the Oct. Meetup at Barley Mill Pub, again at 7:00-8:30P.

<p>
Post-CRP-Response Meeting<br>

7pm 7/25/07<br>

BTA Office, 233 NW 5th<br>

</p>

<p>
This meeting may have been the most productive and efficient in the
history of Shift.  Thank you to Elly for the gently commanding facilitation.
</p>

<p>
ATTENDING: Elly Blue, Steph Routh, Emily Wilson, Norm, Benjamin, Jeff
Cropp, Carl Larson, Brian Scrivner, Jeff Bernards making a guest appearance
</p>

<p>
GUEST BUSINESS:<br>

- Norm would like to create banners (one for each bridge) for Breakfast
on the Bridges, considering the old signs have been worn out or lost.
He had a preliminary design, it looked great, some people gave feedback
on the wording.  He'll create banners and bring them to BonB (or give
them to a BonB person?).  Thanks much, Norm!
</p>

<p>
FINANCE:<br>

- City Repair OK'd the proposal for extending their fiscal sponsorhip of
Shift until December 31st, 2007, under the condition that high-liability
events (heavy boozing) are not carried out under CR sponsorship during
this time.  By that time, most likely Shift will be under the financial
sponsorship of Umbrella which is going now through the submittal process
for 501©3 status.  Steph gave a brief summary of the Umbrella
project.  Basically, Umbrella was formed to encourage and support
community-based street culture with a specific emphasis on reclaiming
public space and alternative transportation.  Umbrella would do the
tedious paperwork and needed fundraising for other projects, which would
be able to concentrate on what they do best (Bike Fun, encouraging
pedestrianism, reclaiming streets for people…).  For the type of
relationship envisioned between Shift-Umbrella, it would be necessary
that everything supported by Umbrella is a “project.”  Could Shift be a
“project”?  It was decided that one way this could work is for Shift
areas such as MCBF, BonB, Pedalpalooza, etc. to all be unique “projects”
and the Shift regular expenses not related to one of these could be its
own project “being Shift” which gets renewed every year for purposes of
tax accounting (a “project” must have a beginning and end).<br>

- We briefly discussed other finance management options other than
Umbrella as fiscal sponsor, for the hundredth time: not having any
non-profit status (we would not have access to some of our most imporant
contributions for Pedalpalooza / MCBF costs), another group besides
Umbrella as the sponsor (there is no group that is anywhere close to as
good a fit), Shift becomes its own official non-profit (all of the
people who would be likely to work on something like this are already
working on Umbrella). We hopefully decided once and for all that when
Umbrella is ready with official 501©3 status, that Shift would
transition from City Repair to Umbrella for fiscal sponsorship.<br>

- Emily gave reportback on finance situation: Shift now has two
$20/month regular donations by employees of Intel through a company
choose-your-organization donation program.  Payments have been made to
Portland Mercury (insertion of Pedalpalooza calendars in PM issues), the
printer for the PP calendars, Stumptown Printing for the PP posters,
Gabe for graphic design &amp; coordination of PP printed material &amp; Portland
Mercury promotion, oh crap I think I'm missing one or two.  Shift is
nearly broke but not completely (meeting was going very fast at this point).
</p>

<p>
SHIFT PROCEDURES:<br>

- Tasks of Shift finance person according to Emily: tracking money,
communicating financial info among appropriate persons &amp; organizations,
maintaining financial details for tax and accounting purposes.  Emily
proposes having a 2nd finance person as a backup and for double-checking.<br>

- We agreed that important Shift organizing roles should be defined
someplace.  Too many times, important tasks did not get done and windows
of opportunity missed because someone assumed someone else was getting
work done, or wasn't clear on what their responsibility was.  Brian to
be the person to nag Shift organizers to come up with a definition of
their duties.  These will most likely be posted to the Shift website
wiki, but this is to be worked out later.  Target date for having all
Shift roles clearly defined is the October busy-ness meeting (Oct. 3rd,
location TBA).<br>

- There should be a system for tracking progress with important tasks
such as selling Pedalpalooza printed calendar ads.  Progress would be
posted to wiki or shiftadmin email list, this way lack of progress would
be immediately apparent and action taken.  Details to be worked out
later, but we did decide that this is an important goal.
</p>

<p>
SHIFT MEETING SCHEDULE:<br>

- Benjamin proposed that Shift meetings be twice-monthly, with the first
meeting serious-stuff oriented, and the second one a meet &amp; greet or
“Shift meetup” more social event.  APPROVED.  We discussed having them
on the traditional schedule as they've been for awhile, 1st &amp; 3rd
Wednesdays, 7P.  APPROVED.  We then realized there would be a need for a
“meeting nag” or person to keep track of who will be facilitating/taking
notes for each meeting &amp; send them reminders to show up or get
replacements, also to get agenda requests out on the list.  Ben
suggested he could be this person.  APPROVED.  We discussed an
appropriate timeline for having the agenda appear on the Shift list and
having a final agenda.  One week in advance was the suggestion for first
mentioning the upcoming meeting and asking for agenda items.  Too soon
and people might forget about the meeting, too late and many might not
get the message.  The final version of the meeting agenda should go out
on the list by the morning of the meeting day.<br>

- Meeting locations: the location should be publicly accessible, quiet
enough for talking, continuously reliable (as in, they won't be
preempted by a live music show or something) and fairly centrally
located.  Using a home would be challenging, the person hosting would
have to be available for every meeting, have enough space, and have no
housemate/spouse/etc. issues with the meetings.  Carl &amp; Brian to head up
effort to search for meeting locations.  The 1st meeting of August will
be skipped, on account of business having just been taken care of so
thoroughly at the July 25th meeting.  Tentative next meeting at Plan B
(formerly Acme) August 15th, 7P.
</p>

<p>
Whew!  You shoulda been there, it was mighty exciting.  Next meeting
(1st Wed. in September, location TBA) to be facilitated by Ben and
note-taken by Emily.  An agenda item for next mtg is Shift booth stuff:
what is needed to have a Shift presence at an event, do we need a Shift
booth, what events?

<h3 id="mcbf">7/11/2007 MCBF</h3>
<div>

<p>
MCBF Wrapup Meeting<br>

6pm 7/11/2007<br>

Col. Summers Park<br>

</p>

<p>
IN ATTENDANCE: Gabe, Carl, Ken (Crow), Kiran, Brad R., Brian (Organic)
</p>

<p>
DISCUSSION boiled down to: much of MCBF went very well, but some of the 
unpleasant surprises (wondering at end of night how to dispose of the 
trash) could have been avoided with more planning ahead, and the beer 
garden encompassing the competitions area was an issue in a couple ways.
 Also, some people took on too many roles due to shortage of dedicated 
coordinators. We will work on documenting descriptions for coordinator 
roles, so that when new people come in they don't have to start from the
 beginning working out how their job is done.
</p>

<p>
BEER GARDEN: many people wanted to have some access to the competitions 
area that are not in the Beer Garden. Also, Beer Garden participants 
want to be able to see the competitions. We discussed how more people 
could be made happy, different configurations for the Beer Garden and 
the competitions. Paved space is fairly limited at Col. Summers… should 
the event be at another venue next year? We seemed to agree that it 
would be preferable to use Summers if at all possible, it is tradition, 
centrally-located, with electricity, running water, and both paved and 
grassy surfaces. We discussed the possibility of all-event drinking w/ 
minors admitted, such as they have for events like Blues Festival. The 
permitting may be too expensive, or we may not be eligable for it due to
 our rep. Kiran looking into it?
</p>

<p>
ITEMS NEEDED: does anyone have a list of items needed every year? An 
idea for centralizing info and making it available to each year's crew 
was to use the Shift website wiki. How many porta-potties needed (note 
to 2008 crew: use construction-grade rather than event-grade 'potties, 
as they usually get vandalized during the event), needs such as paint 
and pens, etc.? Each coordinator should create a list for their role, 
and make sure that info gets saved where the 2008 crew can use it 
(wiki!).
</p>

<p>
DECORATIONS: there seemed to be consensus that there could have been a 
lot more bikey decorations, if the organizers were not spread so thin. 
Dedicated coordinator for next year? There were hundreds of PP posters 
that could have been strung together, also were all of last year's 
pendant strings used? Big ups to Chops on the chalk drawings!
</p>

<p>
CLEANUP: this went fairly well as far as volunteer power, but there 
should be a plan in place before the event how to haul away the trash, 
compost, and recycling. Gabe saved the day by making a competition of 
who could find a dumpster to put a trash bag in first, and the bags all 
went away on two wheels. Cleanup is part of which role, or is there a 
dedicated trash/recycling coordinator?
</p>

<p>
TRANSPORTATION-OF-STUFF: we should not just assume that Robert B. will 
ride all over town picking up stuff for MCBF! Need to make organizing 
this a role or part of a role for 2008, and involve more people, more 
planning-ahead to reduce motor vehicle trips.
</p>

<p>
ORGANIZER DESCRIPTIONS: organizers should make up a description of how their part is done, for next year's person:<br>

- Publicity: Kiran, Carl, Gabe<br>

- Midway: Kirsty<br>

- Food: John D.<br>

- Vendors: Carl<br>

- T-shirts: Carl <em>(and volunteers)</em> <br>

- Decorations: Kelly Peach, Ashley, Chops (chalk)<br>

- Cleanup: who does this?<br>

</p>

<p>
Notice how many areas Carl was carrying! Yay for Team Hardcore! I'm sure
 Carl enjoyed taking on all these things, but there should be more 
people splitting up the work next year. If you are listed here, 
hopefully you will create a task description / items list for next 
year's person (they can be sent to me or put on the MCBF wiki, to be 
created soon).

Pedalpalooza Wrapup Meeting<br>

7pm 7/11/2007<br>

Col. Summers Park<br>

</p>

<p>
IN ATTENDANCE: Carl, Gabe, Emily W., Jonathan, Dan J., Brian, Tall Steve
</p>

<p>
POSTER: about 600 copies were made, only about 100-200 used. Riders 
eagerly scooped up the printed calendars but were often not taking the 
posters. We agreed that posters were probably much harder to put up in 
locations, space is often limited so many places have no room for a 
poster, also posters are more difficult to carry around. Whether to 
print posters at all next year? It costs about the same to print a 
couple hundred as 600 due to setting costs. Print up postcards instead? 
Is another paper means of publicity redundant? We think the posters make
 a cool keepsake, and are more fun to look at. Discussion of having 
calendar and poster distro organized more comprehensively next year, 
maybe having a “Poster Distro Bike Ride.”
</p>

<p>
CALENDAR DISTRO: possibly have bike shops sponsoring calendar distro by distributing calendars at their usual store bike rides?
</p>

<p>
ONLINE CALENDAR: Tall Steve is on board for supporting the 2008 PP 
online calendar. Woot! This thing saves dozens of hours of work since 
event organizers can put up their own event info rather than write to us
 about it and have us creating the schedule.
</p>

<p>
PRINTED MATERIAL COORDINATOR: it was much more of a chore than necessary
 for Gabe to get all the info needed about who to contact / what to do /
 how to schedule. Gabe created a doc for next year with as much detail 
as he knows, it'll be posted later for suggestions / additions. Huh-WRAY
 to Gabriel Amadeus for pulling together this complicated and difficult 
job! Portland Merucry 1/4 page ads: printed stuff coordinator should 
submit these as early as possible, and confirm that they'll appear and 
in what issues. Strive for a single contact person at PM, or send all 
communication to all involve so that nobody is confused as to what is 
happening regarding PM and PP. There were suggestions for the PM to have
 a “Bike Issue” in advance of PP, similar to the “Pride Week Issue,” 
that would go in depth about PP, the bike scene, and play up PM's 
involvement in it. How about a PM-sponsored PP event? Jonathan has been 
talking bike stuff w/ Scott Moore, says he could bring up ideas for more
 reporting and participation for PP 2008. Also: there should always be a
 banner for BikePortland in the printed cal. (come to think of it, also 
the online calendar) considering all the BikePortland support for PP.
</p>

<p>
PP FINANCIAL: the Portland Mercury's printer (Community Newspapers) has 
been paid. Mercury calendar insertion (they give us 50% off) remains to 
be paid. Kickoff Dance Party paid for itself through wine / beer sales. 
There aren't many costs associated with PP other than those, and the 
poster printing. MCBF costs? Didn't get this info.
</p>

<p>
KICKOFF PARADE: there MUST be a parade permit for next year, the 
authorities made it clear that we would not get away with the ad-hoc 
parade again. Possibilities for parade escorting… motorcycles not much 
appreciated due to exhaust, noise, speeding. How about bike officers? We
 (seriously) discussed Clown Corking. Probably not do-able… fun to think
 about. There should be more coordinators, someone to take care of just 
Bike Decoration. The PP Kickoff Parade is where people get their bikes 
“dressed for PP” and there should be more SCRAPpy-ness, more flowers 
plastic or real, more stuffed animals, more organization for decorating.
 Goodwill Bins trips next year to collect stuffed animals and stuff?
</p>

<p>
KICKOFF DANCE PARTY: get a venue to sponsor the dance party event? Could
 the PM sponsor this? This is growing almost too big for out-of-pocket 
free-venue organizing. The only reason the crowd fit into Organics to 
You was the rainy weather deterred a lot of people from showing up. 
Could this still be done with donated venue space next year? Ideas? We 
should plan for 1000 people… This also needs more organizers to step up 
next year, some people (Jasun!) spread very thin trying to cover lots of
 areas.
</p>

<p>
PUBLICITY: how to increase publicity beyond existing bike-fun scene and 
hipsters? We discussed ways that the cycle-commuting and distance-events
 riders could be reached. More publicity venues needed besides printed 
calendar, poster, online calendar, online posts to open-posting sites, 
and local media such as Tribune, Oregonian, WWeek, PM?
</p>

<p>
Again, feel free to make corrections or contribute ideas. If you had an 
organizing role for PP, maybe you'd like to create a description of how 
that job works and send it to me? I'll set up a PP organizing area on 
the Shift wiki soon.

Shift Special Business Meeting - Tuesday, July 3rd, 2007<br>

Meeting Facilitated by: Timo<br>

Minutes Taken by: Matt Picio<br>

</p>

<p>
In Attendance: Emily Wilson, Elly Blue, Timo, Matt Picio, Steve
Kirkendall, Ken Southerland, Steve Upchurch, Benjamin, Tami Sheets, Dan
Miller, Tom Wilburn, Jeff Cropp, Michelle Poyourow, Carl Larson, Ben Salzberg
</p>

<p>
Discussed the status of Shift with the City Repair Project (CRP).
Apparently Hindi (CRP Treasurer) has decided the Emily is the person
to talk to in Shift. Previously, Carie Folz and Dat Nguyen were taking
care of the Shift finances. Emily began assisting after Kari became
pregnant, Dat resigned from Shift duties in May - leaving Emily the
sole person in charge of Shift's finances. Emily gave the following
background of the CRP decision:
</p>

<p>
—
On June 20th, a proposal was brought before the CRP board at a board
meeting to sever the relationship with Shift (specifically to
terminate fiscal sponsorship of Shift). This is apparently due to
OLCC violations recorded at the World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) Dance
Party, potentially opening CRP up to over $15,000 in fines. Due to
some quick negotiation with the OLCC by members of Shift and a stellar
performance at Multnomah County Bike Fair (MCBF), the OLCC did not
levy any fines against CRP. Apparently the board of CRP has decided
that Shift represents too great of a potential financial liability to
continue sponsorship.
</p>

<p>
No one from Shift was present at the CRP meeting, mostly due to a host
of other commitments, many involving Pedalpalooza, and due to short
notification time. Emily had 9 hours' warning before the meeting took
place. Reportedly, the CRP board carefully considered the decision to
terminate fiscal sponsorship of Shift - it was not a “rubber stamp”
meeting. The date CRP proposed for termination of sponsorship is July
31st, 2007. They asked if that date would work for Shift, and if not,
for Shift to propose another date.
—
</p>

<p>
Emily then gave a comprehensive overview of Shift's funds, our bank
balance as of May 31st, and petty cash. Shift's bank balance as of
May 31st was $3,004, which does not take into account a number of
Pedalpalooza invoices, including a $2,500 invoice for the printing of
the calendars. Emily is in the process of obtaining a June month-end
statement from Hindi. Emily also passed out a budget report to the
attendees present. Transportation Options donated $2,000 to Shift
this year for Pedalpalooza, Shift will net $1,860 of that (CRP takes
7% off the top on all donations). There may also be additional monies
coming back to Shift from MCBF and the WNBR dance party.
</p>

<p>
Discussion then turned to the matter of what Shift does next - is July
31st ok? Where to move Shift to for sponsorship? It was generally
agreed that the 12+ individuals present representing Shift did not
want to form a not-for-profit (NFP) corporation on their own. It was
also pointed out that by law, CRP may only transfer the Shift money to
another NFP (specifically a 501©(3) organization).
</p>

<p>
Timo asked that the individuals present representing the board of
Umbrella update those present on the status of that organization.
Matt Picio summarized the mission and purpose of Umbrella for those
who were not familiar with the organization, assisted by Elly Blue and
Carl Larson. All three individuals are currently on Umbrella's Board
of Directors. Umbrella is a NFP corporation formed to promote
alternative transportation and community-based street culture. It was
specifically formed to assist small, informal groups who either cannot
or do not wish to incorporate on their own. Umbrella would provide
(in theory) basically the same benefits as CRP - tax-deductible
donations, insurance, and some CRP does not perform, like assistance
in becoming one's own NFP organization. This is contingent on
Umbrella being recognized by the IRS as a 501©(3) corporation.
Until that happens, Umbrella cannot represent itself as a
tax-deductible public charity.
</p>

<p>
The members of Umbrella present updated the group on the current
status of Umbrella - Umbrella incorporated in April of 2007 and has
completed their 1023 application (for 501©(3) status from the IRS)
and associated documents. Umbrella has had an attorney review the
documentation and is in the process of having a tax accountant also
review the documentation. Matt Picio stated that Umbrella should be
ready to file the 1023 in 2 weeks. Under the best case scenario, it
will take 60 days to receive a ruling from the IRS. Under the worst
case, it could take 6-9 months or longer.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion as to the purpose of Shift, whether Shift
should “pre-emptively” separate from CRP immediately, and what ongoing
items with CRP does Shift need to address. The group generally agreed
that Shift's main focus (roots) is as a communication-oriented group.
We want to bike, we want to have bike fun, we want to tell everyone
about the bike fun (whoever's having it) and have more people having
bike fun. The general sense was “Shift is Shift” - ultimately Shift
doesn't actually “need” money - money makes it possible to do the big
events but the big events could actually exist independently of Shift
- they are not part of Shift's core identity.
</p>

<p>
It was generally decided that Shift is still on friendly terms with
CRP and negotiating an amicable settlement with CRP is in both
parties' best interests. There were questions and concerns about the
money left in the Shift account with CRP - what will happen to it and
can it be transferred to another organization. If transferred to
Umbrella, what would happen to it and how would Shift operate under
sponsorship of Umbrella? Umbrella works on a “project” basis, and
many of Shift's activities don't fit the traditional definition of a
“project”. A lengthy discussion ensued, where it was determined that
the main events (Pedalpalooza, MCBF, WNBR, Car-free Day) easily fit
the typical definition of a “project”, and that the compilation of the
“day-to-day” activities of Shift (Breakfast on the Bridges, the
mailing list, the website, etc) would fit under an expanded definition
of “project” - effectively the project would be “Being Shift”. It was
agreed that Umbrella needs to have a clear definition of what a
project is in order to negotiate how Shift would operate if sponsored
by Umbrella.
</p>

<p>
Steve (Upchurch?) raised the question of Shift's growth - can Umbrella
handle the growth of Shift's events. Elly pointed out that one of the
missions of Umbrella is to help growing groups become 501©(3)'s on
their own, and in that case, Umbrella could assist Shift (or another
group, say if MCBF wanted to be their own NFP) to incorporate and go
off on their own. (Emily also mentioned that point) Steve Kirkendall
pointed out that the size of Shift events is growing but the number of
Shift events is not, so the administrative load isn't growing as fast
as it might appear.
</p>

<p>
The two main decisions to come out of the end of the meeting were that
Shift has decided at this time to move to sponsorship under Umbrella
if and when Umbrella becomes a 501©(3). Shift will develop a
fallback plan in case Umbrella doesn't work out or cannot become a
501©(3). Shift will also propose to CRP that they continue to
sponsor Shift until the end of the calendar year (Dec 31) under the
provision that Shift will not use CR's insurance policy number or OLCC permit.
The remaining events for Shift for this year are Car-free Day, which
will mostly be handled by combining it with the Belmont Street Fair,
and Breakfast on the Bridges, which while potentially a liable event -
is a level of liability which CRP expects and is prepared to deal
with. Emily will negotiate on Shift's behalf with CRP to try to
accomplish this.
</p>

<p>
Pedalpalooza-related “stuff” was tabled until the PP wrap-up meeting
scheduled for July 11th at Colonel Summers Park.
</p>

<p>
Ben proposed we split the bi-monthly Shift meetings into a business
meeting (the 1st Wednesday) and a “meet-up” (or “social” meeting - on
the 3rd Wednesday). Michelle pointed out that the BTA had similar
issues with their staff meetings - splitting the official functions
from the more “social” aspect of the meetings has worked well for
them. A motion was made, seconded and approved to bring this up for
review and discussion at the next (non-PP wrapup) meeting. That
meeting was scheduled for July 25th in the BTA offices at 6pm.

<p>
The meeting was held upstairs at Old Town Pizza. In attendance: Micah (facilitating), John (his first meeting), Emily, Steve, Gabe, Elly (taking notes), Carl, Brad, Dat, Tomas, Scriv, Ken S., Timo, Steph R., Savannah (filming us for the bike documentary), and a cameo appearance by Dead Letter Ben.
</p>

<p>
1. Earthday – this City Repair event is on April 21st this year. Shifters are working on the following:
-Leading bike rides to the event: Aaron and Steven Kung
-Valet bike parking: Carl and Aaron
-Smoothies: Kyr
-Transportation Fair: Kirsty? Is she doing this? Does she need a hand?
-Shift table: Brian (needs vols!)
-T-shirtmaking party for Shift shirts to sell at the Shift table: Ken or Carl will host this, more details to come. Steph R. and Gabe can provide silk screens. Gabe is working on this year's logo. There was some discussion of whether it's appropriate to put the “Bikes Allowed Full Lane” with ORS number on the back of Shift shirts, since this is not what the statute says, but rather an interpretation of it. It was decided not to use it. Some shirts will be made with the Move By Bike logo as well.
</p>

<p>
2. Towards Carfree Cities Conference – Shift is hosting the conference in 2008, work is starting now. The conference is set tentatively for mid-June '08, to coincide with Pedalpalooza. The next planning meeting will be April 2nd (a monday) – watch <a href="http://www.portlandcarfreeday.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.portlandcarfreeday.org" rel="nofollow">www.portlandcarfreeday.org</a> for details, or join the “portlandcarfreeday” mailing list at riseup.org.
</p>

<p>
3. Pedalpalooza –
Cal/Poster art: Gabe passed around some exciting sample images, incorporating the St John's Bridge with a determined-looking cyclist (which is what you need to be to bike over that bridge).  
</p>

<p>
Flagship rides update:
-Kickoff parade –Dat submitted a route permit, leading from Jamison Park in NW to Col. Summers in SE. Dr. Wasabi is organizing the bike decorating party beforehand.
-Bike movie – we think Shawn is doing this at the hostel again – Shawn?
-World Naked BikeRide / Kickoff Dance Party – we really need a few good organizers for this. Dead letter showed up to offer his space, the Watershed, down near Oak's Bottom. There were some concerns that it was too far from downtown, and other concerns that when the naked ride goes downtown the group gets broken up and riders have to stop a lot, which you don't want to happen when you're biking around naked. Other venue ideas were for spaces at NW 23rd and York, and NE 24th and Sandy.
-MCBF: Carl, Kiran, Timo, Dat, Ken, and others are working on this. They'll report back at the next meeting, but want the world to know that the stickers just came in.
</p>

<p>
Web calendar: Steve has been working hard to make this look good and be usable.   He wants everyone to know that he's entered some major events under his own name just to get them up there, but that doesn't mean he's running them. Here's where to view it so far, and add your own events: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza/pp2007.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza/pp2007.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza/pp2007.php</a>
</p>

<p>
Pedalpalooza Committee reports: Emily and Brian are doing a great job with ride recruitment. Steve K. is going to put a link to the Pedalpalooza 2007 calendar at the top of the shift website. People should talk to Dat and Micah about sponsorship, they're working on figuring out costs at this stage. The City of Portland is one sponsor already on board.
</p>

<p>
4.Shift calendar – Some people find the new shift calendar harder to read than the old one. People feeling vehemently about this or having suggestions should contact Brian at captainplanet at hevanet dot com.

<br>
<br>

–There was some talk of various ride ideas but we wanted to keep those brainstorms for a different meeting.
<br>
<br>

–One idea was to maybe include some non-ride events this year.  Like lectures, seminars, etc?  But then others chimed in saying the essence of PP is riding, and that we can never have too many riding events.

</p>

<p>
Next meeting: Feb 21st (Weds) 7pm, location to be announced
</p>

<p>
1. Meeting location: Carl is committed to finding us a new, regular, central meeting location. As predicted, the Lucky Lab was very loud and we all had to shout, which was kind of fun.
</p>

<p>
2. Voodoo jerseys : This matter was resolved. Also, there are about 35 Shift jerseys remaining. Talk to Dat (dontbecreepy at gmail) if you want to buy one.
</p>

<p>
3. Shift budget : City Repair is switching accountants and no information about our money or actual money will be available for another week or so. The next meeting will have a budget report.
</p>

<p>
4. Umbrella group update :  “Umbrella” is a new nonprofit in the works that will be a coalition among transportationy groups in Portland who don't want or aren't ready for their own nonprofit status. It is being formed largely with Shift in mind, so some shifters who aren't super-involved with Umbrella ought to come meet on the 15th at 8pm (not sure where yet, email me for details) to a) find out what sort of benefits and responsibilities might come with Shift membership and/or b) take part in decisions about how the group will operate.
</p>

<p>
5. Pedalpalooza: 2 + weeks of bike fun! From June 7th to 23rd this year. We have a basic team and need more people to pitch in. Gabe is stepping up to design calendar and poster and spoke cards and fliers. Steve is on task with the on-line calendar. Carl will be working on a ride leader's planning kit, and also on coordinating listings (along with Emily). Jacque will work on promotions. Dat and Micah will coordinate sponsorship. All of us will pull out all the stops to make sure that world class bike fun events converge in Portland this June. Anyone who wants to work on any of the above items, or has contacts, time, money, or crazy ideas – now's the time to speak up. More email about this to follow.
</p>

<p>
6. Multnomah County Bike Fair (MCBF) : Will occur on June 23rd this year. Kiran will announce a meeting in March to begin planning this major event. The permit application has been filed with the city, and stickers are being printed.
